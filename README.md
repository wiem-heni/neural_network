A major challenge in content based medical image retrieval systems is the semantic gap that exists between the low level visual information captured by imaging devices and high level semantic information perceived by human. 

To solve this problem we proposed a deep learning classifier by using deep convolutional neural network that is trained for classification of medical images. (CNN : subtype of NN mainly used for applications in image recognition)   

The CNN is built-in convolutional layer reducing the high dimensions of the image without losing its information.  

Our dataset contains three classes. The learned features and the classification results are used to retrieve medical images.  

To implement this solution we used:

TensorFlow: The core open-source library to help you develop and train ML models. 

Keras: Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow. 

Matplotlib : model testing visualization throw confusion matrix and accuracy graph  

Flask: is a microframework for Python used to display graphical results of the search engine.
